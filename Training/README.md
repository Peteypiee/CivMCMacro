# Training ground
## What is it ?
The training ground is a concrete platform located in fempire (6500,-6000), to learn the different aspects of JSMacro. It was initially created by arthirob, and is meant for public access for anyone who wants to learn JSMacro.

## How to use it ?
You can just access it, and the list of challenges should be written in signs. Each challenge should help you learning a specific function. When nothing is written, you don't need bastion access, but you'll sometimes needs it.

## I can't find a solution !
In this folder, you'll find a proposition of a way to resolve all the challenges of the training ground. Anyone can propose their own solution if they think it's worth sharing ! If multiple solutions have been proposed, they are separated with an underscore

## I have no idea how to do any of this
Feel free to ask to arthirob#1530 (they/neutral) on discord. They love to teach other people ! :)
